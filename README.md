# 🧠 English–French Translator using LSTM (Seq2Seq Model)

This project implements an English-to-French translation app using a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model built with LSTM layers in TensorFlow/Keras. It includes a Tkinter GUI for real-time translation.

## 🚀 Features
- Encoder–Decoder LSTM Model
- Character-level One-Hot Encoding
- Tkinter GUI for instant translation
- Preprocessing and model saving/loading

## ⚙️ Requirements
```bash
pip install tensorflow scikit-learn numpy
